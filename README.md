#Audio Visualizer

##Running Locally
Running this application locally requires the projSpotifyAuth.js
file to run on a node server by calling 'node projSpotifyAuth.js'.

spotifyAuth.js must be modified on lines 12, 13, and 14 to contain your own
Spotify Web Application's credentials which can be created at
https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/.

Any domains you host the application to must also be added in Spotify's developer
dashboard as well. For more information on the Spotify Web API, check out the
documentation found here: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/
